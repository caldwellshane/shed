# shed
A place to keep tools. Here we're collecting functions for understanding how quantum computers work.

# Installing
Conda makes it really easy to install the thorniest dependency, `qutip`, so there's a `conda-env.yml` file to support that.
We then make an editable install of `shed`, ie.
```
# pip install -e <shed-directory>
```
